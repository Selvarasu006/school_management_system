# school_management_system
I designed and maintained a school management system, creating tables for students, teachers, subjects, marks, and classes. I have used CRUD operations and features stored procedures for querying specific information, as well as a view for tracking low marks. Additionally, I implemented a ranking system to assign ranks to students based on their marks.
